select e.first_name,e.last_name,s.salary from employees as e
 join salaries as s on e.emp_no=s.emp_no
 where s.salary =
(select max(salary) from salaries);

here i have to join the two table, namely : employee and salaries table,
then use the conditional query "where s.salary"  is equal to the result obtained from the sub-query.
