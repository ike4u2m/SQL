select e.first_name,e.last_name,s.salary from employees as e
 join salaries as s on e.emp_no=s.emp_no
 where s.salary =
(select max(salary) from salaries);

here i have to join the two table, namely : employee and salaries table,
then use the conditional query "where s.salary"  is equal to the result obtained from the sub-query.


#finnding the nth

SELECT DISTINCT s.salary, s.emp_no
FROM (
  SELECT salary, emp_no, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM salaries
) AS s
WHERE s.salary_rank = 3; # keep substituting the number to et desired result



# find the second highest earner
select max(salary) from salaries where salary<
(select max(salary) from salaries);
# or 

select max(salary) from salaries where salary not in
(select max(salary) from salaries);

#find the 3rd salary
select max(salary) from salaries where salary <
(select max(salary) from salaries where salary not in
(select max(salary) from salaries));

#or

select max(salary) from salaries where salary <
(select max(salary) from salaries where salary<
(select max(salary) from salaries));
